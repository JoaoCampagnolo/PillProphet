This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a drug or treatment advancing into clinical trials based on scientific papers and financial market data.

### Project Overview

- **Data Sources**: 
  - Scientific papers published by pharmaceutical companies.
  - Financial market data (share values before and after announcements).

- **Objective**:
  - To predict the approval/rejection of drugs/treatments entering clinical trials.

- **Methodology**:
  - Scrape and preprocess scientific papers.
  - Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract features.
  - Analyze market reactions to news about drugs/treatments.
  - Train and validate machine learning models.

- **Execution Environment**:
  - The initial development and model training will be conducted using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a free GPU environment.

### Current Status

- Initial setup completed; data collection and preprocessing are in progress.
- Exploring potential features and models for prediction.

### Future Work

- Improve feature engineering techniques.
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., clinical trial metadata, patents).
- Optimize and evaluate machine learning models.

### How to Run

- Clone this repository and open the notebook in Google Colab to start training the model.
